# Salty Lychee
A simple password hashing library with random salt support developed in Java.

## How to use
```Java
import SaltyLychee;

String plainPassword = "password";
String hashedPassword = SaltyLychee.hash(plainPassword);
// outputs: true
System.out.println(SaltyLychee.verify(plainPassword, hashedPassword));
```

## Features
It supports:
| feature    | description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| algorithm  | SHA-256     |
| salt       | random salt |
| stretching | 2^10 times  |

Theoretically, to crack the password generated by the library,
you need a rainbow table with:
```
62^8 * 2^10 ~ O(10^17)
```
combinations of hash values.
If each hashing process takes 0.5 sec, 
the calculation would take more than 3.5 billion years.

## Prospect
SHA-3, salt length / stretching cost choices
